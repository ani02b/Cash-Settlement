# Cash-Settlement
It aims to reduce the complexity of the transaction network where multiple people are involved.
It uses the Splitwise Debt Clearance algorithm to solve the generated problem.
Min heap is used to implement the algorithm properly and effectively. (Ref. "HOW IT WORKS" in Report.pdf)

Splitwise Algorithm: The Splitwise algorithm is designed to efficiently settle debts among a group of individuals who share expenses. Splitwise is a popular application that helps users track shared expenses and simplifies the process of settling debts among friends, family, or groups. The algorithm aims to minimize the total number of transactions needed to settle all debts, making it a practical and user-friendly solution.
